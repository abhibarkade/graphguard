# CI Workflow: Tracking Service
#
# This workflow handles schema validation and deployment for the Tracking microservice
# in the logistics-federation example.
#
# Triggers:
# - On PR: Validates schema changes before merge
# - On main push: Automatically deploys validated schema
#
# Path filters ensure this only runs when tracking service files change
